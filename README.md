## Overview

This repository is an historical archive of a real-time 3D engine that I developed in the mid 90s.

It's written mostly in 'C'. It runs on MS-DOS with VGA and SVGA resolutions on a 256 colors palette.

Major features are:
- Gouraud shading
- Texture mapping
- Basic lighting and material properties
- Z-Buffer (optional)
- Cool menu interface

## Copyright

Code and executables are my own. It's free to use. Redistribution should include credits.

3D models are not built by me. They were found from multiple sources about 30 years ago. I'm assuming that they are as good as public domain by now. If you are the author and wish to be credited, please let me know.
