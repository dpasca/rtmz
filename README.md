## Overview

This repository is an historical archive of a real-time 3D engine that I developed in the mid 90s.

It's written mostly in 'C'. It runs on MS-DOS with VGA and SVGA resolutions on a 256 colors palette.

Major features are:
- Gouraud shading
- Texture mapping
- Basic lighting and material properties
- Z-Buffer (optional)
- Cool menu interface
